However, without specific options to evaluate, I can provide general information on apoptosis:

Apoptosis is indeed a crucial process in living organisms for maintaining tissue homeostasis and preventing cancer. It involves a series of cellular changes leading to cell death, which is regulated by various signaling pathways.

Common misconceptions or incorrect statements about apoptosis might include:

1. Apoptosis is always harmful: While excessive apoptosis can lead to tissue damage, it's also necessary for eliminating damaged cells.
2. Apoptosis is the same as necrosis: Necrosis is a form of cell death that results from acute cellular injury and is not regulated by the same pathways as apoptosis.
